## 0.38.0 proposed — public Matrix4 authoring

**SOURCE_ONLY / NOT_RUN. S091 / V042** proposes typed matrix authoring in `@egret/engine/scene3d`: `createMatrix4`, `multiplyMatrix4` and the original `Math3DError` / `Math3DErrorCode` bindings. Editor and JSON source arrays can become owned tuples and compose transforms before existing scene capture. The proposal reuses Egret's independently authored matrix algorithm through thin public forwarders.

Implementation, actual RED/GREEN, public behavior/types, current full gates and delivery are **PENDING**. Clock **0.37.0** delivery is **PENDING at this preparation cutoff**; earlier recorded results and cutoffs are retained. Broader scene/rendering, performance, complete Spine and migration acceptance remain separate.

**Recorded delivery successor:** Clock **0.37.0** was merged through [PR #24](https://github.com/cnedwin/Egret_rebuild/pull/24), with Main `8f84d5f99281ad051abd2e061b5aff90d6d0f40b` read back locally and remotely. This supersedes the earlier delivery checkpoint without rewriting it and establishes no Matrix acceptance or remote CI PASS.

See the [public scene contract](en/docs/public-scene3d-contract.md) for the proposed API and authoring example.
**Actual 0.38.0 successor:** the old public SDK passed **17** retained cases and refused **4** new cases at the named missing-API assertion; its positive type consumer reported **4** missing exports. The newly built SDK passed **168/168** retained math, projection, scene and public cases, including **21/21** public cases. The positive consumer compiled; **11** intentional import negatives were bound to actual diagnostics, and exact boundary/strict-type gates passed with **0** unexpected failures. Original math algorithms remain unchanged. No new GPU, device or performance acceptance is claimed. Independent source/bilingual review, the full repository gate and delivery remain PENDING at this successor cutoff. See [the shared verification record](evidence/public-matrix-authoring-verification.json).

## Engineering preview 0.37.0 — opt-in F1 Clock candidate

**S090 / V041** records the original F1 Clock experiment; **D017 remains proposed** and concerns only its trusted session and explicit opt-in provenance. Saved private CPU execution passed **10/10** Clock cases, including the named after-advance fault, and **3** assigned wrong-copy controls with fresh baselines. The original manual **12/12** remains unchanged. Saved private desktop WebGPU execution passed **10** positive readbacks and **1** separate double-update control: **30** original positive samples, **120** channels, tolerance **0**, with full-byte repeats and bounded cleanup. Counts are not added to historical runs.

**Portable public Clock source/replay, current full gates, final bilingual review, mandatory push and 0.37.0 delivery are PENDING at this curation cutoff.** Private results do not substitute for them. The former 0.36.0 blocks below retain their historical pending cutoff; 0.36.0 was subsequently delivered through [PR #23](https://github.com/cnedwin/Egret_rebuild/pull/23), Main `36909c3c1b2b9ef9784cb71d949ef6eba142fc0a`.

Official external `@esotericsoftware/spine-core@4.3.13` is attributed, neither bundled nor relicensed. Integration/distribution qualification remains unverified. Complete Spine **R020/V020 remains OPEN**; these observations establish no phone/Native SDK, physical GPU, OS process retirement, performance/energy or complete-product acceptance.

## 工程预览 0.37.0 — 可选 F1 Clock 候选

**S090 / V041** 登记原创 F1 Clock 实验；**D017 仍为 proposed**，仅涉及实验的受信会话及显式可选出处。已保存私有 CPU 执行通过 **10/10** Clock 用例，包含具名推进后故障；**3** 项指定错误副本对照各有新基线。原手动 **12/12** 保持不变。已保存私有桌面 WebGPU 执行通过 **10** 次正例回读及 **1** 次独立重复推进对照：**30** 个原始正例采样点、**120** 个通道、容差 **0**，并观察完整字节重复与限定清理。各阶段数量不与历史运行相加。

**公开 Clock 可移植源码／重放、当前完整门禁、最终双语评审、必要推送及 0.37.0 交付，在本次策展截止时均为 PENDING。** 私有结果不能替代这些步骤。下方 0.36.0 段落保留历史 pending 截止状态；0.36.0 后续已通过 [PR #23](https://github.com/cnedwin/Egret_rebuild/pull/23) 交付，Main 为 `36909c3c1b2b9ef9784cb71d949ef6eba142fc0a`。

官方外置 `@esotericsoftware/spine-core@4.3.13` 明确署名，不打包、不改许可。集成／分发资格仍未核实。完整 Spine **R020/V020 继续 OPEN**；上述观察不构成手机／Native SDK、物理 GPU、操作系统进程退役、性能／能耗或完整产品验收。

阅读 [Clock 指南](Cns/experiments/spine-f1/README.md)、[已保存核验](evidence/spine-f1-clock-verification.json)和[待完成公开投影](evidence/spine-f1-clock-public-projection.json)。
A subsequent actual replay of the public source in an independent clone passed manual **12/12** with **6** original controls and full Clock **10/10** with **3** assigned controls; the named fault actually executed, with **0** skipped accepted cases. Separate default-headless WebGPU execution passed **10+1** readbacks, **30** positive samples and **120** channels at tolerance **0**, retaining original full-byte relations and bounded cleanup. Cold import/help observed **280** modules and **0** Core/GPU/host accesses. The saved CPU collection retains its earlier native-pending cutoff; the separate native receipt is the actual successor. Original source and input identities remained unchanged. Independent saved-result review, final repository gates and delivery remain PENDING here; full Spine **R020/V020 remains OPEN**. See the current successor in the linked Clock verification/projection records.

## Engineering preview 0.36.0 — original F1 Spine experiment

An opt-in original two-region manual bridge connects real resources and owned Mesh2D geometry. Portable CPU execution passed **12/12** original tests and **6** assigned controls, each with a fresh baseline. Complete Spine **R020/V020 remains OPEN**.

Separate browser WebGPU validation recorded **8** positive submissions and **1** assigned double-update error control; a separate **3**-read classification actor verified `PIXEL_FAIL`. These results are not combined. The prepared public CPU/browser reproduction tool also passed in a new clone with the same **8+1** profile; these are repeated observations, not additional feature coverage. Its finite independent review has **0** open findings. The public checkout also passed the same CPU/browser profile. **Final publication gates and 0.36.0 delivery remain PENDING at this cutoff.** Read [the experiment guide](en/experiments/spine-f1/README.md), [verification](evidence/spine-f1-manual-verification.json) and [projection provenance](evidence/spine-f1-public-projection.json) for exact profiles, original oracles, source terms and remaining UI/runtime/creator/migration work.

The preceding **0.35.0** was actually delivered through [PR #22](https://github.com/cnedwin/Egret_rebuild/pull/22). Its recorded gates and Main identities are in the guide/evidence; **0** remote statuses and **0** check runs establish no remote CI PASS. Earlier PENDING cutoffs below remain history.

## 工程预览 0.36.0 — 原创 F1 Spine 实验

可选的原创两区域手动动画桥接接入真实资源与自有 Mesh2D 几何。可移植 CPU 执行通过 **12/12** 项原始测试及 **6** 项指定错误对照，各项均先通过全新基线。完整 Spine **R020/V020 继续 OPEN**。

另行浏览器 WebGPU 桌面验证记录 **8** 次正例提交及 **1** 项重复推进指定错误对照；独立的 **3** 次读回分类 actor 验证 `PIXEL_FAIL`，各组结果不合计。已准备的公开 CPU／浏览器复现工具也在一个新 clone 通过相同 **8+1** profile；这是重复观察，不增加特性覆盖。其有限独立评审有 **0** 项开放问题。公开 checkout 也通过相同 CPU／浏览器 profile。**本截止点，最终公开门禁及 0.36.0 交付继续 PENDING。** 精确 profile、原创 oracle、来源条款及后续 UI／runtime／创作／迁移工作见[实验指南](Cns/experiments/spine-f1/README.md)、[验证](evidence/spine-f1-manual-verification.json)与[投影出处](evidence/spine-f1-public-projection.json)。

前一版本 **0.35.0** 已经 [PR #22](https://github.com/cnedwin/Egret_rebuild/pull/22) 实际交付；其记录的门禁及 Main 身份见指南／证据。远端 **0** 项状态和 **0** 项检查任务不证明 CI 通过。以下早先 PENDING 截止点继续保留为历史。
